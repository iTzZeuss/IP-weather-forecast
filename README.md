This is a script that gets user's geolocation from their IP adress, with the help of an API.
It then sends that geolocation to another API which responds with the weather of the full 24 hours of the user's day.
Finally, it is supposed to be sent from the server to the user through emailing. However this feature is in a sandbox environment and therefore doesnt work, simply because it is a test project.
